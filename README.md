## Introduction
The Automatic Pet Feeder System is designed to automate the process of feeding pets by dispensing food at scheduled times. This project utilizes Arduino-compatible hardware components and is programmed using the Arduino IDE.

## Features
- Scheduled Feeding: Users can set feeding times for multiple meals throughout the day.
- Portion Control: Adjustable portion sizes ensure appropriate feeding quantities.
- Manual Feeding: Provides the option for manual feeding outside of the scheduled times.
- LCD Display: Allows users to interact with the system and view feeding schedules.
- Real-Time Clock (RTC): Ensures accurate timing for scheduled feedings.
- Servo Motor: Controls the dispensing mechanism to release the desired amount of food.

## Components Used
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller board
- DS3231 RTC module
- Servo motor
- Keypad
- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)


## Usage
1. Set Feeding Times: Use the keypad to set feeding times and portion sizes for each meal.
2. View Feeding Schedule: View the feeding schedule on the LCD display to ensure correct programming.
3. Manual Feeding: Trigger manual feeding by pressing the corresponding button on the keypad.
4. Monitor Operation: Monitor the system's operation and make adjustments as necessary.
